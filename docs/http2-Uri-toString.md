# [HTTP Message v2](http2.md) / [Uri](http2-Uri.md) :: toString
 > im\http2\msg\Uri

## Description
Return the string representation as a URI reference

This method adheres to the PSR7 rules:

- If a scheme is present, it MUST be suffixed by ":".
- If an authority is present, it MUST be prefixed by "//".
- The path can be concatenated without delimiters. But there are two
  cases where the path has to be adjusted to make the URI reference
  valid as PHP does not allow to throw an exception in __toString():
    - If the path is rootless and an authority is present, the path MUST
      be prefixed by "/".
    - If the path is starting with more than one "/" and no authority is
      present, the starting slashes MUST be reduced to one.
- If a query is present, it MUST be prefixed by "?".
- If a fragment is present, it MUST be prefixed by "#".
